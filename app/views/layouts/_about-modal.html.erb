        <p>Cousin Gift Exchange was created to solve the problem of not everyone in the family being able to attend Thanksgiving and therefore not being able to participate in our traditional drawing of names for the cousin gift exchange.<br>
        <br>
        Also, with everyone getting hitched and having kids and whatnot, the whole thing is getting super complicated. As luck would have it, one of us is learning how to program and needs practice solving issues like this with code.<br>
        <br>
        If you have opted to participate, please check back on Dec. 12th for the "drawing" results. These will be displayed on the Drawing Results page.<br>
